# Internship Management System – Front-End Prototype
**German University in Cairo – Spring 2025**  
*Software Engineering Course Project*

## Project Overview

This repository contains the front-end prototype of a role-based Internship Management System developed during the second milestone of a software engineering course. The prototype was implemented using **React** and **JavaScript**, and it simulates a multi-user internship workflow involving students, companies, faculty members, and the university's administrative office.

The primary objective of this milestone was to translate given user requirements into an interactive interface, emphasizing usability, clarity, and logical task flow. All backend logic is simulated using mock data.

## System Roles and Capabilities

The system was built with role-based access and navigation, covering the following use cases:

- **Student Interface**  
  - Create profile  
  - Apply to internships  
  - Submit reports  

- **Company Dashboard**  
  - Post internship opportunities  
  - Review and accept student applications  
  - Evaluate interns  

- **Faculty Portal**  
  - View submitted reports  
  - Grade interns  

- **SCAD Office (Admin Panel)**  
  - Approve companies  
  - Track student status and internship activity  

Each interface adapts to the expected tasks and permissions of the corresponding user type.

## Design and Usability Focus

The front-end implementation was evaluated based on the following product management criteria:

- Learnability and discoverability of features  
- Task efficiency and clarity of user journeys  
- Feedback mechanisms and error handling  
- Consistency of UI components and layout  
- Responsiveness across screen sizes  
- Alignment with user mental models  
- Navigation reversibility and intuitive structure  
- Professional and cohesive visual theme

The development process prioritized experience-centered design, simulating how real-world product managers assess usability in early-stage prototypes.
## Live Prototype Access

This front-end prototype is deployed and accessible at:

To explore the system, you can log in by entering any name and using one of the following email formats:
- `@student.com`  
- `@prostudent.com`  
- `@company.com`  
- `@faculty.com`  
- `@scad.com`  

Then use the "Forgot Password" option to proceed to the dashboard.

## Technology Stack

- **React** for front-end component structure  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for logic and interactivity  
- **React Router** for client-side navigation  
- **Custom CSS** for styling and layout  
- **Hardcoded mock data** in place of backend services

## Disclaimer

This prototype was developed solely for educational purposes.  
No backend or database integration is included. All functionality is simulated. 

## Pre-Development Phase (Milestone 1)

Before development, we completed a structured requirements engineering phase that included:

- A complete set of **functional user stories**, defined without UI/UX assumptions  
- **Seven non-functional requirements** covering performance, scalability, and maintainability  
- Two documented versions: one written manually, and another using AI assistance to improve prompting skills and efficiency in drafting software requirements  

This phase was essential in establishing a clear, traceable specification from which our implementation was derived.
